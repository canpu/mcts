    "Generally speaking, *Monte Carlo* methods are a set of algorithms that use random sampling techniques to estimate the value of unknown parameters. Monte Carlo methods are particularly useful when the state space in question is large enough that brute force enumeration is infeasible. By employing the Law of Large numbers, we know that *“As the number of identically distributed, randomly generated variables increases, their sample mean approaches their theoretical mean.”* This law serves as the basis for Monte Carlo methods. As a simple example, Monte Carlo methods can be used to estimate the mathematical value Pi. This is shown in the image above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees on the other hand are a restricted form of a graph that allows us to model a wide variety of decision making processes. Importantly, we can employ search methods over a tree to quickly find the optimal solution, given that the tree is of reasonable size. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens when we combine both paradigms? One way to think about *Monte Carlo Tree Search* is that the *Monte Carlo* mechanism serves as a method for estimating the value of a particular state in the game, done commonly with a random rollout policy, and the *Tree Search* mechanism uses an exploitation-exploration tradeoff with the value estimate and the visitation count of the node to determine which node to expand next. \n",

    "### Bandit Problems\n",
    "<img src=\"img/random-bandit-cartoon.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bandit Problems* are a class of sequential decision making problems where an agent must chose between $K$ actions in order to maximize the cumulative reward of the agent for some amount of time horizon.  For example, the agent (the bandit) in the scenario shown in the image above is an octopus, and the possible actions available to the octopus at any point in time correspond to the available slot machine levers. The goal of the octopus is to devise an optimal policy via experimentation because the underlying reward distribution associated with each lever is unknown. This means that the octopus must estimate the potential reward of pulling a particular lever based on the past observations of taking this action. This introduces the **exploitation-exploration dilemma**: the bandit needs to take advantage of the knowledge it has already gained about the system to make choices associated with high rewards, but the bandit must also must consider unexplored actions to learn more about the underlying reward distribution of said action. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful construct for encoding the exploitation-exploration dilemma is **regret**, where regret is the expected loss for the bandit due to not acting optimally.  In this sense, an appropriate strategy for the bandit would be to minimize this regret. To express the regret of the bandit after *n* plays, defined as $R_n$ we can write: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_n = \\mu^*n - \\mu_j \\Sigma_{j=1}^{K} \\mathbb{E}[T_k(n)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu^*$ is the best possible expected reward and $\\mathbb{E}[T_j(n)]$ is the expected number of executions of action $j$ across $n$ trials [[1]](#references). This leads us to the notion of an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) that a particular action is optimal because UCB suggests a policy to follow in order to minimize the growth of regret for the bandit over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)\n",
    "A useful notion for tackling bandit problems is the upper confidence bound (UCB) that a particular action is the optimal action.  The UCB is useful because it allows the agent to consider both exploitation and exploration when considering what state to explore next. Perhaps the most famous example of a UCB is known as UCB1, shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{UCB1} = \\bar{X_j} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\text{ln} (n)}{n_j}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term, $\\bar{X_j}$  represents the current estimated value of action $j$, which improves over time as sampling continues. This serves the exploitation term: when the average value of a particular action is high, we would like to exploit this action in the future. The next term,  $\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\text{ln} (n)}{n_j}}$ represents the number of times that node $j$ has been sampled relative to its siblings. Here, $n$ is the number of times that node $j$’s parent has been visited in the tree, and $n_j$ is the number of times that node $j$ has been visited. This serves as the exploration term: as the value of $n_j$ relative to $n$ decreases, the UCB value increases, and we are encouraged to explore relatively unexplored states. This version of UCB can readily be extended to include an additional weighting term between the exploration and exploitation terms. We won’t get into the math here, but to summarize, the UCB1 method takes advantage of the Chernoff-Hoeffding inequality to establish provably slow growth of regret for multi-bandit problems [[2]](#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## MCTS Algorithm <a id=\"mcts-alg\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "As discussed in lecture, the MCTS algorithm is a general framework that consists of four key phases: *Selection*, *Expansion*, *Simulation*, and *Back-Propagation*. During the *Selection* and *Expansion* phases, the *Tree Policy* is used, while during the *Simulation* phase, the *Default Policy* is used. The MCTS algorithm allows the *Tree Policy* and *Default Policy* to take on many forms. In this mini-pset, we will focus on using the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) to serve as the *Tree Policy* and Random Rollout as the *Default Policy.* Both of these policies are discussed in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/paper-mcts.png\" style=\"width: 700px;\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into UCT and Random Rollout, it is important to remind ourselves of the two fundamental concepts that MCTS is build upon: the value of an action may be approximated by using random simulation, and that these values may be used efficiently to adjust the policy towards a best-first strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT)\n",
    "Generally speaking Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) refers to an MCTS algorithm that utilizes some UCB variant in the tree selection policy. In our case, we will use UCB1 with an added weighting factor as our selection policy. This means that during our selection phase, we select the node with the best UCT value. Keep in mind that the UCT term already includes both exploitation and exploration incentives. Pulling things together, we get the following equation for UCT:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{UCT} = \\bar{X_j} + 2 C_p \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\text{ln} (n)}{n_j}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Again $\\bar{X_j}$ is the estimated value of taking action $j$, $n$ is how times the parent node has been visited, $n_j$ is the number of times action $j$ has been taken from this state, and $C_p$ is the additional weighting factor that can toggle the relative importance of the exploitation and exploration terms. If multiple nodes are found to have the same UCT value, the tie is broken by randomly selecting one of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UCT criteria for *Selection* and *Expansion* is what allows for asymmetric tree growth, shown in the figure below. This asymmetric tree growth is why MCTS performs better compared to brute-force exhaustive search and pruning techniques for adversarial games, such as Alpha-Beta pruning, because MCTS will focus its search on promising areas of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/paper-tree-growth.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Policy: Random Rollout \n",
    "Once an action has been selected and expanded, it is now time to perform simulation in order to retrieve an estimate for how good (or bad) this particular state is. This is where the *Default Policy* is used to get from the current state to a terminal state. Once at the terminal state, we can assess the value of this simulated version of the game and use back-propagation to share this information up the tree. As mentioned previously, we harness the power of random sampling in our *Default Policy* by employing *Random Rollout*. Random Rollout simply chooses actions randomly from the set of possible actions at a given state until a terminal state is reached. It’s that simple. It is also possible to incorporate some heuristics to guide the behavior of the rollout, but we will not consider heuristics at this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows an example of a random rollout for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Since the blue circle ends up winning the game, they improve the estimated value of the first move that was made. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/random-tree-rollout.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fun Example: AlphaGo Zero\n",
    "Before jumping into the implementation work of this problem set, we quickly mention a recent example of using MCTS to devise the best Go-playing AI system to date: AlphaGo Zero, to help motivate the power of MCTS. AlphaGo Zero three core components: MCTS, Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning. The MCTS is used in AlphaGo Zero to determine which node to expand next in the tree, just like how we will utilize MCTS in this mini-pset. However, AlphaGo Zero also uses a Neural Network to assess the value of a state and Reinforcement Learning to update the weights of this Neural Network. Also, AlphaGo Zero had the luxury of playing against itself MANY times (approximately 19.6 million self-play games), on a high-powered machine. That said, MCTS is still the workhorse that pucks out the next move to make. [[3]](#references)\n",

    "Now that you have implemented the MCTS algorithm, you should be ready to use it run it on the Gomoku problem. The Gomoku game that we provide you with has already been partially played out in order to prevent long run-times on the Jupyter hub. That said, please note that the simulation may take up to 3-5 minutes to complete the game. To ensure that the simulation always terminates in a reasonable number of steps and to make sure that the results observed by everyone are similar, we have fixed the random seed. Also, note that black tokens start off with an advantage, so if they were a good Gomoku player, they should always win. Keep this in mind when you interpret the simulation results. The initial game state is shown below.\n",

    "The following two code bocks offer two different simulations that you can test your MCTS algorithm on. The first simulation considers all free board spaces as a possible “next_action”. However, the second simulation only considers the free board spaces that are adjacent to a non-free board space to be part of the set of possible “next_actions”. Essentially, this adjustment serves as a heuristic that biases the search towards adjacent action sequences rather than playing moves randomly across the board. "

However, vehicles are not allowed to transition into a tile that contains an obstacle. Obstacles are shown in red in the visualization. The valued regions are shown as blue circles, with the larger circle representing a higher reward region. \n",

To be more specific, you need to implement four key properties/methods, namely `is_terminal`, `reward`, `possible_actions` and `take_action`. We have have provided you with the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `MazeAction` Class\n",
    "`MazeAction` Constructor:\n",
    "1. `MazeAction(agent_index, position)`: constructs a `MazeAction` object,  where `agent_index` is an int that indicates which AUV should move, and position is an `(int, int)` tuple representing the location the agent is moving toward. \n",
    "    - For example `MazeAction(0, (10,10))` would be a `MazeAction` object that represents agent 0 moving to position (10,10). \n",

    "`MazeAction` Properties: \n",
    "1.  `agent_index` : the index that represents which agent performed this action \n",
    "1.  `position`: the position that the agent moved to by taking this action\n",
    "\n",

    "### `MazeEnvironment` Class\n",
    "`MazeEnvironment`  Properties:\n",
    "1. `rewards`: a dictionary mapping position of type `(int, int)` to a reward value of type `float`\n",
    "1. `obstacles`: a set of position locations `(int, int)` , such that every grid cell contained in the `obstacles` set is considered an obstacle\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### `UnfinishedMazeState` Class\n",
    "`UnfinishedMazeState` Properties:\n",
    "1. `paths`: a list of paths, \\[`path_0`, `path_1`, `path_2`, $\\ldots$\\], where each path `path_i` is a list of position tuples `(int, int)` that represent the trajectory of agent `i`. The first `(int,int)` tuple in `path_i` is the initial state of agent `i` and the last `(int, int)` tuple in `path_i` is the current state of agent `i`. pa the last tuple is current position of agent $i$. This property records the trajectories of all agents. \n",
    "1. `time_remains`: an int that represents the number of time steps remaining in the problem (this represents the time-horizon constraint that the mission must be completed by *x* time)\n",
    "1. `visited`: the set of visited position tuples `(int, int)` (the union of the visit locations amongst the multiple agents)\n",
    "1. `turn`: an int object indicating which agent should move. It is assumed the first agent is given by `int=0`\n",
    "1. `switch_agent`: which will properly update `turn` so the next agent can move; if all agents have moved for a round, then the `time_remains` property would be updated\n",
    "1. `environment`: a `MazeEnvironment` object that represents the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "`UnfinishedMazeState` Methods:\n",
    "1. `switch_agent()`:  updates the `turn` property to indicate that it is next agents turn. Once all agents have moved for a given time-interval round, then the `time_remains` property would be updated.\n",
    "1. `is_in_range(position)`: takes in a position tuple `(int, int)` as input and returns a bool, that indicates  whether a position is inside the problem domain."
